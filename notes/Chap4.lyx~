The early development of quantum mechanics and the early applications of
 quantum mechanics to elucidating the structure of matter required little
 mathematical sophistication.
 It has been said that "In the 1930s, under the demoralizing influence of
 quantum theoretic perturbation theory, the mathematics required of a theoretica
l physicist was reduced to a rudimentary knowledge of the Latin and Greek
 alphabets.

Contextuality concept emerges when we would describe an ontological reality
 via operationalism.
 If we will be able to show quantitatively the dependence of the context,
 then we can states to assist a quantum signature.
 Quantitatively means that only quantum mechanics can saturate some inequalities
, in our case Englert's inequality.
 First of all, we need some notion of contextuality.
 Then we will focus on our attention on the anomalous weak values (no go
 theorem).
 There exixts an anomalous weak value than we get contextual-dependence.

Contextuality means that if you have two equivalent experimental procedures,
 there exist two different probability distribution in the hidden variable
 model (ontological model).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We should applying such idea for the Englert's inequality.
 We need to find two equivalent decompositions for a channel.
 One decomposition should be written associate to the disturbance and another
 decomposition which is non perturbed, connected to the visibility.
 Then, if there is no context-dependence Englert's inequality is never violated
 with this value, but if we get the saturation in the inequality, then those
 two decomposition must be different in the hidden variable model, although
 they represent the same channel.
 Alternatively, if you measure an anomalous weak value, than Englert's inequalit
y is violated.

Ontological model

).
 An ontological model is complete description of a system without any reference
 to epistemic knowledge or ignorance.
 From the Greek ὄν, genitive ὄντος: "of that which is", is physical, real.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philosophical discourse traditionally distinguishes between ontology and
 epistemology and generally enforces this distinction by keeping the two
 subject areas separated.
 However, the relationship between the two areas is of central importance
 to Physics, since it is an experimental science.
 For instance, many measurement-related problems force us to consider both
 our knowledge of the states and observables of a system (epistemic perspective)
 and its states and observables, independent of such knowledge (ontic perspectiv
e).
 Ontological and epistemic perspective are strongly related by the operationalis
m.

\begin_layout Fact
Operationalism and realism.
 A researcher in quantum foundations can be operationalist or realist.
 For the operationalist, operators in Hilbert space represent preparation,
 transformation and measurement procedures, specified as lists of instructions
 of what to do in the lab.
 For the realist, there is some deeper reality underlying the equations
 of quantum mechanics that ultimately accounts for why we see the measurements
 we do

In a complete model there is an element corresponding to each element of
 reality.
 A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibilit
y to predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system (0).
 In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical qunatities described by
 non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of
 the other.
 Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function is
 not complete or (2) there two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality.

\begin_layout Claim
In an ontological model for an operational theory, the preparation procedure
 prepares the ontic state of the system.
 If is not the case, we require the introduction of hidden variables.
 Therefore, often we call hidden variable model to refer an ontological
 theory.
 However, there are systems such that the same preparation procedure does
 not imply the same outcome.
 It means that for each outcome does not exist any procedure which garantee,
 if we repeat, to obtain exactly that outcome (determinism 
\begin_inset Formula $\nRightarrow$
\end_inset

reproducibility).
 Nonetheless, we strongly require the opposite implication, hence the same
 preparation procedure implies a deterministic probability distribution
 of ontic states.

 a birifrangent crystal both oriented along the

\end_inset

 axis.
 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{3}$
\end_inset

 and

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{n}_{\theta'}$
\end_inset

 It turns out that after many msmts 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(k|M_{1}\right)=p\left(k|M_{2}\right)=p$

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{n}_{\theta'}$
\end_inset

) and the other related to the object (polaroid, crystal).
 The axis specifies the equivalence class.
 The object, cannot specifies the equivalence class, because we cannot distingui
sh which object we used, therefore a variation of this feature does not
 change the equivalence class of the procedure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
(
\emph on
context of experimental procedure)
\emph default
.
 Given an experimental procedure with some features, it can be defined in
 different equivalence classes, by different probability distribution.
 We have two types of features.
 A variantion of the first type of feature gives different probability distribut
ions, hence different equivalence classes.
 This first type of feature is specified by specified the equivalence classe
 that the procedure falls in.
 A variation of the second type of feature cannot specify an equivalence
 class because a variation of it does not change the probability distribution.
 The set of the feature of the second type-those that are not specified
 by specifying the equivalence class- we call 
\emph on
context 
\emph default
of the experimental procedure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the knowledge of the context (we used polaroid or crystal) does
 not enable to predict the outcomes of an experiment any better than if
 only knew the equivalence class (the axis 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{n}_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{n}_{\theta}$

A

\emph default
is an attempt to offer an explanation of the success by assuming that there
 exist physical systems that are the subject of the experiment.
 These systems are presumed to have attributes which describe the real state
 of affairs of the system.
 Thus, a specification of which instance of each attribute applies at a

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Essentially, you reckon with the ontic, you understand the ontological:
 the ontic is something adequately grasped by something like counting, while
 the ontological is something grasped only adequately when it is seen and

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, we mathematically expose the ontological model for an operational theory.
 We shall denoted the complete set of the variables in an ontological model
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\Lambda$
\end_inset

, and the space of values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

\begin_layout Itemize
for an operational msmt M, the probability of obtaining the outcomes labelled

 over the ontic states, 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{M,k}:\Omega\mapsto\left[0,1\right]$

\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{T}:\Omega\times\Omega\mapsto\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\Lambda}\Gamma\left(\lambda',\lambda\right)d\lambda'=1,\negthickspace\forall\lambda.$

We would like to specify that in general an experimental procedure in an
 ontological model might depend on both its equivalence class (first kind
 of feature, e.g.
 axis 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{n}_{\theta}$
\end_inset

) and its context (second kind of feature, e.g.
 polaroid or crystal).
 It is natural, however to take into account only the equivalence classes
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\forall\left[P\right],\left[M\right],\left[T\right]\right)$
\end_inset

, as we have seen in the example.
 For each representant of the equivalence class 
\begin_inset Formula $P\sim P'$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $T\sim T'$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $M\sim M'$
\end_inset

 should be 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(k|P,T,M\right)=p\left(k|P',T',M'\right)$
\end_inset

.
 If it is the case the operational model is 
\emph on
noncontextual ontological model.

\begin_layout Standard
Remember, we say that two procedure are equivalent 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(P,T,M\right)\sim\left(P,T,M\right)'$

 because they prepare the ontic state of the system in precisely the same
 way.

Remarkable, for testing a noncontextual theory wheter ontological deterministic

 Bohm's theory) or indeterministic (e.g.
 Bohr's rule) the appropriate quantities to examine are the epistemic probabilit

 ontic state of the system.
 This is useful to remark the different role of the contextuality and the
 indeterminism.

 of the msmt is determined for all ontic state iff the ontic state 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is represented by the set of idempotent indicator function 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \chi_{k}\left(\lambda\right)\right\} _{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Interestingly, even for objectively deterministic ontological model msmts
 exhibit outcome determinism: the knowledge of the ontic state and the equivalen
ce class is not suffiecient to fix uniquely the outcome.
 It might only fixed uniquely specifying the context of the msmt.
 This means that we are describing not only the system itself, but even
 the environment.
 In order to take into account the environment in the msmt procedure the
 indicator function cannot be idempotent.
 In this description we lose the outcome determinism assumption, but the
 probability distribution either can or cannot depend on the context.
 This latter dependence is required to declare if the model is or not is
 contextual.
 In fact if we required noncontextuality then for all equivalence class,
 all the element are represented by the same set of non-idempotent indicator
 function.

Violation of causality principle implies nonlocality, analogously violation
 of independence of the equivalence class implies contextuality.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Because the indicator function for a measurement specifies the dependence
 of the outcome on the ontic state of the system under investigation, and
 not the dependence of the outcome on the ontic state of any systems that
 make up the measurement apparatus or the environment, such a measurement
 must be represented by a non-idempotent set of indicator functions.
 Nonetheless, it may still be the case that for each equivalence class of
 measurements, all the elements of the class are represented by the same
 non-idempotent set of indicator functions, and this is all that is required
 for the measurements to be deemed noncontextual by our definition.

\begin_layout Standard
In the following we present three no-go theorem, in particular we proof
 that given an ontological model plus P-noncontextuality (for preparations)
 and T-contextuality (for transformations) is incompatible with quantum
 mechanics (qm).
 Funny, M-contextuality is still compatible with quantum mechanics (Beltrametti-
Bugaski ontological model).
 But if introduce the extra assumption of outcome determinism for unsharp
 msmt then ontological model+M-noncontextuality+outcome determinism is not
 compatible with qm.

Let us assume that the thesis is not true.
 Hence given 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{x}$
\end_inset

 there exists a probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\left[P_{x}\right]}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 on the ontological level for a noncontextual preparation procedure quantum
 theory.
 Whetever is the context of the preparation procedure the state 
\begin_inset Formula $I/2$
\end_inset

 must not depend on the particular preparation according to the definition
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\left[P_{x}\right]}\left(\lambda\right)=\mu_{I/2}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ P_{aA},P_{bB},P_{cC},P_{abc},P_{ABC}\right\} \subseteq\left[P_{x}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lem:(distinguishability)"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 distinguishable preparation procedures are represented by nonoverlapping
 ontological distributions
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu_{a}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{A}\left(\lambda\right)=0,\;\mu_{b}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{B}\left(\lambda\right)=0\;\mu_{c}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{C}\left(\lambda\right)=0.\label{eq:nonoverlappingdistribution}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Futhermore, even for 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{aA},P_{bB},P_{cC},P_{abc},P_{ABC}$
\end_inset

 correspond the following ontological distributions via 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lem:(convex-combination)"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mu_{aA}\left(\lambda\right)= & \frac{1}{2}\left(\mu_{a}\left(\lambda\right)+\mu_{A}\left(\lambda\right)\right)\nonumber \\
\mu_{bB}\left(\lambda\right)= & \frac{1}{2}\left(\mu_{b}\left(\lambda\right)+\mu_{B}\left(\lambda\right)\right)\nonumber \\
\mu_{cC}\left(\lambda\right)= & \frac{1}{2}\left(\mu_{c}\left(\lambda\right)+\mu_{C}\left(\lambda\right)\right)\nonumber \\
\mu_{abc}\left(\lambda\right)= & \frac{1}{3}\left(\mu_{a}\left(\lambda\right)+\mu_{b}\left(\lambda\right)+\mu_{c}\left(\lambda\right)\right)\nonumber \\
\mu_{ABC}\left(\lambda\right)= & \frac{1}{3}\left(\mu_{A}\left(\lambda\right)+\mu_{B}\left(\lambda\right)+\mu_{C}\left(\lambda\right)\right).\label{eq:convexsumdistribution}
\end{align}

\end_inset

Thus we required the equalities 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{aA}=\mu_{bB}=\mu_{cC}=\mu_{abc}=\mu_{ABC}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nonoverlappingdistribution"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:convexsumdistribution"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 holds for a fixed ontic state 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\Lambda$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to see that the only solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{aA}=\mu_{bB}=\mu_{cC}=\mu_{abc}=\mu_{ABC}=0$
\end_inset

 which is not an ontological probability distribution.
 In fact 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{x}\mu_{X}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=a,b,c$
\end_inset

 and for 
\begin_inset Formula $X=A,B,C$
\end_inset

 means that one is vanishing.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{x}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=a,b,c$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\left[P_{x}\right]}\left(\lambda\right)=0$
\end_inset

 in the 4th row, hence even 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{X}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $X=A,B,C$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{a}\mu_{b}\mu_{C}=0$
\end_inset

 implies 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}\mu_{c}=\frac{1}{3}\mu_{c}$
\end_inset

, and it goes back to the first case.
 The other case restore this two situations.

Is this proof very general? Since we proof for the maximally mixed state

Let the following msmt procedure

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \Pi_{c},\Pi_{C}\right\} $

 For 
\begin_inset Formula $x=a,b,c$
\end_inset

 after the msmt 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{x}$
\end_inset

 the states collapse in one of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \Pi_{x},\Pi_{X}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{x}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

.
 By the definition of a PVM 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \Pi_{x},\Pi_{X}\right\} $
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{x}+\Pi_{X}=I$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{x}\Pi_{X}=0$
\end_inset

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=a,b,c$

 Notice that the for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{x}$
\end_inset

 the eigenvalues are 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=a,A,\dots,C$
\end_inset

.
 Let us assume the outcome determinism for PVM (sharp) at ontological level,
 hence the sets of idempotent indicator functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \chi_{I_{x}}\left(\lambda\right),\chi_{I_{X}}\left(\lambda\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=a,b,c$
\end_inset

.
 By definition 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi_{I_{x}}\left(\lambda\right)+\chi_{I_{X}}\left(\lambda\right)=1\qquad\chi_{I_{x}}\left(\lambda\right)\chi_{I_{X}}\left(\lambda\right)=0.\label{eq:ontological_PVM}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{X}$
\end_inset

 are the ontological regions associated respectively to the projectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{X}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{x}\cup I_{X}=\Lambda$
\end_inset

 after the msmt 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{x}$

 the state is projected on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{x}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{X}$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover from 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{a}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{b}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}$
\end_inset

 one can construct another msmt procedure 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 described by the POVM 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \frac{1}{3}\left(\Pi_{a}+\Pi_{b}+\Pi_{c}\right),\frac{1}{3}\left(\Pi_{A}+\Pi_{B}+\Pi_{C}\right)\right\} =\left\{ I/2,I/2\right\} $
\end_inset

 which correspond at the ontological level the set of indicator functions
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\{ \frac{1}{3}\left(\chi_{I_{a}}\left(\lambda\right)+\chi_{I_{b}}\left(\lambda\right)+\chi_{I_{c}}\left(\lambda\right)\right),\frac{1}{3}\left(\chi_{I_{A}}\left(\lambda\right)+\chi_{I_{B}}\left(\lambda\right)+\chi_{I_{C}}\left(\lambda\right)\right)\right\} .\label{eq:POVMcontextual}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Regardless the preparation procedure 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 for this POVM we have always the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Tr\rho I/2}=1/2$
\end_inset

 outcome.
 Then, It follows that the equivalence class of msmt procedure that contains
 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 also contains the msmt 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{M}$
\end_inset

 that ignore the system and just flips a fair coin to determine the outcome.
 Let us see at the ontological level.
 Since the outcome does not depend on the system at all, regardless the
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 there is the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 for each outcome, so it is represented by the set of indicator function

is the unitary operator describing a rotation by 
\begin_inset Formula $\vartheta$
\end_inset

 about the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 axis in the Bloch sphere.
 By this transformations we can build a new one 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{x}$
\end_inset

 that takes all points in the Bloch sphere and projects them onto the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 axis.
 There are many ways to implement 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{x}$
\end_inset

, specifically,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{T}_{x}= & \frac{1}{2}\left(\mathcal{T}_{0}+\mathcal{T}_{\pi}\right)\\
= & \frac{1}{2}\left(\mathcal{T}_{\frac{\pi}{3}}+\mathcal{T}_{\frac{4\pi}{3}}\right)\\

 The T-noncontextuality assumes that for each of these seven transformations
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\vartheta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{x}$
\end_inset

 is associated on the space of ontic states a unique transition matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\vartheta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{x}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Analogously to the lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 a convex sum of transformation procedures is represented in an ontological

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
T_{x}= & \frac{1}{2}\left(T_{0}+T_{\pi}\right)\\
= & \frac{1}{2}\left(T_{\frac{\pi}{3}}+T_{\frac{4\pi}{3}}\right)\\
= & \frac{1}{2}\left(T_{\frac{2\pi}{3}}+T_{\frac{5\pi}{3}}\right)\\

= & \frac{1}{3}\left(T_{\frac{\pi}{3}}+T_{\pi}+T_{\frac{5\pi}{3}}\right).

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\vartheta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\vartheta+\pi}$
\end_inset

 map any 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 lying in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z-x$
\end_inset

 plane of the Bloch sphere to a pair of orthogonal density operators.
 Orthogonality at operational level correspond to nonoverlapping ontological
 distribution (wheter we assume ontic or epistemic view, as we show later).
 It follows from lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lem:(distinguishability)"

 that the trnasition matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\vartheta}$

\begin_inset Formula $T_{\vartheta+\pi}$
\end_inset

 must take any distrubition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{x}\left(\lambda\right)$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\rho_{\vartheta}}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{\rho_{\vartheta+\pi}}\left(\lambda\right)=\int_{\Lambda}T_{\vartheta}\left(\lambda,\lambda'\right)\mu_{x}\left(\lambda'\right)d\lambda'\int_{\Lambda}T_{\vartheta+\pi}\left(\lambda,\lambda'\right)\mu_{x}\left(\lambda'\right)d\lambda'=0.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now consider how our seven transition matrices affect the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{a}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 represented at the operational level by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 We restor exactly the contradiction for P-noncontextuality.
 This contradiction is due to the fact that we assume for T-noncontextual
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\left[\mathcal{T}\right]}\left(\lambda',\lambda\right)=\Gamma_{T}\left(\lambda',\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

, but we have demostrated that it is not possible be consistent with qm.

\begin_layout Section
P-noncontextuality assumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditionally noncontextuality is restricted only to the definitino of M-noncont
extuality for sharp msmt.
 Is it natural to extent the assumption even for P- and T-noncontextualityand
 for M-noncontextuality for unsharp msmt? First of all, let us see why contextua
lity is a mystery in need of explanation.
 One can assume that nonlocality is a good assumption, unless the classical
 concepts.
 Therefore let us assume that the universe is fundamentally nonseparable
 or that such causal influences can propagate faster than the speed of light.
 It seems almost cospirational that it is not possible superluminal communicatio
n.
 Analogously, let us assume that the qunatum statistics depend on the detail
 (context) of the experiment.
 It is reasonable.
 But, then, it is very surprising that when one considers any valid probabiliry
 distribution over the ontic states ( that is, any distribution that characteriz
es what someone who knows only the preparation procedure knows about the
 ontic state) the weighted average over the statistics of outcomes does
 not depend on the detail of the experimental procedures.
 Both the examples apprear cospirational.
 Removing appear of cospirational from contextuality as the same worth of
 the reconciling between relativity and Bell's theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let us focus on the attention only for P-noncontextuality.
 To answer if it is natural or not we need to define the epistemic view
 and the ontic view of pure states.
 For mixed states the ontological interpretation is the same, they represent
 the partial knowledfe of the whole system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
(ontic view) Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 the space of pure states, an ontological model adopts an ontic view of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 if all distinct elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 are represented by disjoint distributions in the ontological model, that
 it 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho\neq\rho'\Rightarrow\mu_{\rho}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{\rho'}\left(\lambda\right)=0\quad\forall\rho,\rho'\in\mathcal{S}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
disjoint distributions corresponds to different elements of reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
(epistemic view) Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 the space of pure states, an ontological model adopts an epistemic view
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 if only orthogonal operational elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 are represented by disjoint distributions in the ontological model, that
 it 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho\perp\rho'\Rightarrow\mu_{\rho}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{\rho'}\left(\lambda\right)=0\quad\forall\rho,\rho'\in\mathcal{S}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
Of course 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\perp\rho'\Rightarrow\rho\neq\rho'$
\end_inset

, therefore orthogonality at the operational level is a sufficient condition
 for disjointness in the ontological level wheter one adopts an ontic or
 an epistem view.
 In other words, the request of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\neq\rho'$
\end_inset

 in the ontic view implies that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 correspond an element of reality different from other elements of reality.
 Instead, from the epistemic point of view 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 represent only partial knowledge of that element of reality 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 which can have other information in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho'\neq\rho$
\end_inset

, and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\perp\rho'$
\end_inset

 we have different elements of reality even for the epistemic view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
An ontic view of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 rules out the possibility of preparation noncontextuality trivially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
An implicit commitment to such a view can lead to the impression that the
 assumption of prepration noncontextuality is unnatural.
 Consider the preparation procedure above 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{x}$
\end_inset

 represented in quantum formalism via 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{x}$
\end_inset

 giving 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=a,A,b,B$
\end_inset

.
 An ontic view of pure quantum states implies that nt onlu are the orthogonal
 stetes associated with disjoint distrubitions
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mu_{a}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{A}\left(\lambda\right) & =0\\
\mu_{b}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{B}\left(\lambda\right) & =0
\end{align}

\end_inset

but also nonorthogonal states area associated with disjoint distributions,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mu_{a}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{b}\left(\lambda\right) & =0\\
\mu_{a}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{B}\left(\lambda\right) & =0\\
\mu_{A}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{b}\left(\lambda\right) & =0\\
\mu_{A}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{B}\left(\lambda\right) & =0
\end{align}

\end_inset

It is then clear that the preparation procedure at the operational level
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{aA}\longleftrightarrow1/2\left(\sigma_{a}+\sigma_{A}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{bB}\longleftrightarrow1/2\left(\sigma_{b}+\sigma_{B}\right)$
\end_inset

 are represented by distributions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{aA}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{bB}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{aA}\mu_{bB}=0$
\end_inset

.
 It is not possible because both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{aA}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{bB}$
\end_inset

 are represented by the same density operator at the operational level,
 namely 
\begin_inset Formula $I/2$
\end_inset

, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{aA}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{bB}$
\end_inset

 must be represented by the same ontological distribution in the P-noncontextual
 ontological model.
 Thus the ontic view of quantum pure states trivially precludes the possibility
 of P-noncontextuality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
Implicit commitment comes form the natural language which brings to the
 idea that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 represent some real quantity rather than the agent's knowledge.
 For instance, describing the photon polarization, the several convex decomposit
ions of the completely mixed states 
\begin_inset Formula $\propto I$
\end_inset

 sometimes is thought as an equal mixture of states of horizontal and vertical
 polarization, or as an equal mixture of statesof left and right circular
 polarization.
 This two preparations are statistically indistinguishable.
 This four states of polarization can be thought as mutually exclusive states
 of affair and are therefore ontic states.
 But from the epistemic point of view we can refer to the same element of
 reality.
 Even if this two preparations are statistically indistinguishable, there
 exists some msmt that could tell these two cases apart? In virtue of the
 fact that the answer is negative, since it is connected only to a common
 language and not to a rigorous model, the naturalness of P-noncontextuality
 is a priori very plausible in the perspective of the epistemic view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impossibility of a preparation noncontextual ontological model appears
 all the more shockhing to the devoted realist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Outcome determinism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the proof of M-contextuality we assume outcome determinism for PVM (sharp
 msmt), which are idempotent indicator function in the ontological model,
 and outcome indeterminism for POVM (unsharp msmt), which are nonidempotent
 indicator functions in the ontological model.
 The notion of M-noncontextual does not depends on this assumptions.
 This assumption seem very natural, but there exist other assumption a priori
 very plausible, as well: (1) PVM and POVM are outcome determinism; (2)
 or outcome indeterminism (3)Toner, Bacon Ben-Or (4) Bacciagaluppi

.
 Let us start from the first case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume outcome determinism also for unsharp msmt.
 In M-noncontextuality consider a msmt procedure 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{x}$
\end_inset

 associated with POVM 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ I/2,I/2\right\} $
\end_inset

 must be represented in an ontological model by the sep of indicator functions
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1/2,1/2\right\} $
\end_inset

 which are not idempotent, and thus in a M-noncontextual ontological model
 outcome determinism of unsharp msmt is not allowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second alternative consitutes the weakest assumption and consequentlu
 the most general framework for an ontological model.
 It should be inappropriate to call no-go theorem our theorem for M-contextualit
y for qm,if we do not justify the assumption of outcome determinism.
 The noncontextuality should be inconsistent with epistemic statistics of
 qm because of outcome determinism and not because M-contextuality.
 Therefore the outcome determinism assumption should be a natural consequence
 of the M-noncontextuality assumption.
 If it is not the case, the proof, and any other proof as Bell's theorem,
 Kochen-Specker serve to rule out the possibility of M-noncontextuality.
 It turns out, however that the assumption of outcome determinism for sharp
 msmt can be justified by an assumption of P-noncontextuality.

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mu_{k}\left(\lambda\right)\right\} _{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \rho_{k}\right\} _{k}$
\end_inset

 are orthogonal for the lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\Omega_{k}}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{\Omega_{k'}}\left(\lambda\right)=\delta_{k,k'}$
\end_inset

, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{k}\cap\Omega_{k'}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $k\neq k'$
\end_inset

.
 The P-noncontextual ontological model must be compatible a priori with
 the epistemic statistics given by the Bohr's rule 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Tr}\left(\rho_{k}\Pi_{k'}\right)=\delta_{k,k'},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

therefore in the ontological model, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\int_{\Lambda}\xi_{k}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{\Omega_{k'}}\left(\lambda\right)d\lambda= & \int_{\cup_{k}\Omega_{k}}\xi_{k}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{\Omega_{k'}}\left(\lambda\right)d\lambda\\
= & \int_{\Omega_{k'}}\xi_{k}\left(\lambda\right)\mu_{\Omega_{k'}}\left(\lambda\right)d\lambda=\delta_{k,k'}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The second equality is due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{k}=\left\{ \lambda|\:\mu_{\Omega_{k}}\left(\lambda\right)>0\right\} $
\end_inset

 and the last is due to the compatibility with the operational level.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\xi_{k}\left(\lambda\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & \lambda\in\Omega_{k}\\
0 & \lambda\not\in\Omega_{k}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

or equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{k}\left(\lambda\right)\xi_{k'}\left(\lambda\right)=\delta_{k,k'}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\Lambda=\cup_{k}\Omega_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the second point, let us notice that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda=\left\{ \lambda|\:\mu_{\rho}\left(\lambda\right)>0\:\text{for some }\rho\right\} .
\end{equation}

\end_inset

However, ince every density operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 appears in some convex decomposition od the completely mixed state 
\begin_inset Formula $I/d$
\end_inset

, and since P-noncontextuality implies that there is a unique distribution
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{I/d}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 associated with this state, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 is simply the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 assigned non-zero probability by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{I/d}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda=\left\{ \lambda|\:\mu_{I/d}\left(\lambda\right)>0\right\} .
\end{equation}

\end_inset

But given that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{k}$
\end_inset

 form a convex decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $I/d$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k}\frac{1}{d}\mu_{k}\left(\lambda\right)=\mu_{I/d}\left(\lambda\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which implies the partition 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda=\cup_{k}\Omega_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 This esthablishes outcome determinism for PVMs all of whose elements are
 rank 1.
 Since an arbitrary PVM can always be obtained by coarse-grainig of rank-1
 PVM, and since coarse-graning takes idempotent functions to idempotetn
 functions, any PVM is represented by a set of idempotent indicator functions.
 This establishes that the assumption of outcome determinism for sharp msmt
 follows from the assumption of preparation noncontextuality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
M-noncontextuality 
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow$
\end_inset

outcome determinism? No.
 If this were possible then we do not need to assume the extra hypothesis
 of outcome determinism to achieve the no-go theorem.
 Without this assumption M-noncontextuality on its own is consisten the
 qm (below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Exercise
What's happen for oblique PVM which sum to the identity? Try to play with
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{+}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
\alpha & 0
\end{array}\right),\qquad P_{-}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 0\\
\alpha & 1
\end{array}\right).

\begin_layout Proposition
M-noncontextuality without outcome determinism assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow$

 compatible with qm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Assumption: objectively indeterministic ontological model of quantum theory
 and ontic view.
 The ontic space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 is simply the set of the Hilbert rays which are the element of the projective
 Hilbert space.
 Thus for every rank-1 projector 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle \left\langle \psi\right|$
\end_inset

 at the operational level corresponds an ontic state called 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\in\Lambda$
\end_inset

.
 There are not hidden variable in this ontological model.
 A preparation procedure in the ontological model associated to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi'\right\rangle \left\langle \psi'\right|$
\end_inset

 is represented as follows 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\psi'}\left(\psi\right)=\delta\left(\psi-\psi'\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

A preparation procedure involving a convex combination of rank-1 density
 operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ p\left(\psi'\right),\left|\psi'\right\rangle \left\langle \psi'\right|\right\} _{\psi'}$
\end_inset

 is represented by the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu\left(\psi\right)=\int_{\Lambda}p\left(\psi'\right)\delta\left(\psi-\psi'\right)\,\mathrm{d}\psi',
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{d}\psi'$
\end_inset

 is the Lebesgue measure on the projective Hilbert space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
A msmt of POVM 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ Q_{k}\right\} _{k}$
\end_inset

 is associated with a set of indicator functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \xi_{Q_{k}}\left(\lambda\right)\right\} _{k}$
\end_inset

 defined by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\xi_{Q_{k}}\left(\psi\right)=\mathrm{Tr}\left(Q_{k}\left|\psi\right\rangle \left\langle \psi\right|\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

These functions are clearly positive by the positivityof 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{k}$
\end_inset

 and sum to unit by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}Q_{k}=I$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \xi_{Q_{k}}\left(\lambda\right)\right\} _{k}$
\end_inset

 depend only on the POVM that is associated with the msmt and not on how
 it was implemented.
 One can see that this model reproduce quantum theory noting that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Lambda}\mu_{\psi'}\left(\psi\right)\xi_{Q_{k}}\left(\psi\right)\,\mathrm{d}\psi=\mathrm{Tr}\left(Q_{k}\left|\psi'\right\rangle \left\langle \psi'\right|\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\color red
but the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \xi_{Q_{k}}\left(\lambda\right)\right\} _{k}$
\end_inset

 associated with any PVM 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \Pi_{k}\right\} _{k}$
\end_inset

 is not idempotent.
 This is clear since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Tr}\left(\Pi_{k}\left|\psi\right\rangle \left\langle \psi\right|\right)$
\end_inset

 s only 0 or 1 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 lies in an eigenspace of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 The predictions for mixed preparation are also reproduced

.
 In this way the model is obviously preparation contextual since the distributio
n that represents a convex combination of preparation procedures 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\psi\right)=\int_{\Lambda}p\left(\psi'\right)\delta\left(\psi-\psi'\right)\,\mathrm{d}\psi'$
\end_inset

 depends on the particular ensemble of pure states and not just on the density
 operator associated with the mixture.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
I need to integrate this formalism with the chapter 5 applying properly
 the Borel measure.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extending the notion of contextuality even for preparation, transformation
 and unsharp msmts we get the no-go theorem for noncontextuality even for
 2d Hilbert spaces.
 The no-go theorem for P-noncontextual ontological model is based on the
 impossivility or reproducing within a particular kinf of ontological model,
 the conve struture of the set of quantum states rather than the algebraic
 struciture of the set of quantum msmt.
 The contextuality can confine into the preparations and transformations,
 because exist outcomes indeterministic ontological models of quantum theru
 such as the beltrametti bugaski model, that are msmt noncontextual.
 On the otherhand, one cannot confide all the contextuality into the msmts,
 necause the assumption od prepraration noncontextualitu ueilds a contradiction
 on its own.
 (P-noncontextuality implies outcome determinism).
 P-noncontextuality is more fundamental than M_noncontextuality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue of noncontextuality is closely linked with the issue of locality.
 But only one kind of locality that implies M-contextuality.
 Separability, for locality, is the assumption that the ontic state of the
 universe is defined in terms of the ontic states at each point of spacetime.
 The other sort of locality assumption is called local causality.
 It is the assumption that the probability distribution over values for
 a variable in a spacetime region are determined by the values of all the
 variavles in the backward light-cone of this region.

Failure of local causality

 failure of M-noncontextual ontological model (Beltrametti Bugajski model).
